# CVE-SEARCH-NVD


This is a powerful, easy-to-use, and flexible Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for searching vulnerabilities by **CVE ID** or **keywords** using the [NVD API](https://nvd.nist.gov/). The application interacts with the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and uses the `nvdlib` Python package to fetch data related to CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). The tool allows users to:
- Fetch specific vulnerability details by **CVE ID**.
- Search vulnerabilities by **keywords**.
- Display the severity, score, description, and vector for each result.

## Features
- **Search by CVE ID**: Fetch data on specific vulnerabilities using their CVE ID (e.g., `CVE-2021-26855`).
- **Search by Keywords**: Perform keyword-based searches (e.g., `heartbleed`) to retrieve related CVEs.
- **Detailed Information**: Displays the CVSS score, severity, description, and attack vector in a user-friendly format.

## Prerequisites

Before using the CVE Search CLI, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.8+**: The script is written in Python and requires a Python environment.
- **NVD API Key**: The NVD API is rate-limited. You can [register for an API key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key) to avoid delays.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cve-search-cli.git
    cd cve-search-cli


    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`


    pip install -r req.txt


    export NVD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here



    python cve_searcher.py --cve CVE-2021-26855 --api-key your_api_key_here

    source deactivate

    ```

##EXAMPLE OUTPUT


2024-09-09 05:34:49,928 - INFO - Searching for CVE: CVE-2021-26855

CVE Found: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
Severity: CRITICAL - Score: 9.8
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##Search by Keyword
You can also search for vulnerabilities using keywords. This will return a list of CVEs that match the keyword.

```bash
python cve_searcher.py --keyword heartbleed --api-key your_api_key_here
```

##EXAMPLE OUTPUT


2024-09-09 05:42:19,496 - INFO - Searching for keyword: heartbleed

Found 1 CVEs for your keyword search:

CVE ID: CVE-2014-0160
Severity: HIGH - Score: 7.5
Description: The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1_both.c and t1_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
